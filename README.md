# NEOVIM LUA CONFIG

## Idea
Seperate core functionality and specific additions/modifications. Essentially to have a personal setup that can be different from a work setup.

## Installs outside the pluging ( may not be as up to date as I like :joy: )
- `brew install ripgrep`
-  [install nerd fonts](https://gist.github.com/davidteren/898f2dcccd42d9f8680ec69a3a5d350e)



## Patterns

All files are exported moduels with `init` functions.
